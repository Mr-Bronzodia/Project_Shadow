# Overview 
In Behind Every Shadow, the player assumes the role of a shadow assassin in a first-person sneaking game. The objective is to retrieve an artifact that the church recently acquired. The player has a unique ability to create a clone of themselves and switch places with it. The game focuses on player freedom and was inspired by games such as Dishonored and Prey (2017).

# Reflection
This project was a first one to be tested on independent testers. I learnt that real people don’t actually read GDD documents, so I added tutorials explaining main features of the game. One tester even thought of attacking your own clone which crashed the game, doing that would never even cross my mind. I implemented a schedule which made this more rounded and polished experience.
